    <h1 class="about">ABOUT ME</h1>
    <p>I am a 22 year-old full-stack developer from New York. I found a passion for coding when I was a student at the University of Delaware, where I recently graduated. I am also very passionate about basketball. I grew up playing on basketball and baseball teams and continued to play throughout high school on the varisty level. I believe that throughout these years of being an athlete I have developed valuable teamwork skills that will transition to wherever I end up working.</p>
