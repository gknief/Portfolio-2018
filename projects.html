    <h2><a href="https://pages.git.generalassemb.ly/gknief/Project-1-Game-of-Flames/">Game of Flames</a></h2>
    <img src="./images/gameofflames.png" alt="Game of Flames" class="project-img" />
    <p class="projectInfo">I created this game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The idea came from my intrigue for Epic Games' very own <i>Fortnite</i>, a game that involves building structures to shield yourself from incoming bullets by enemies. In this game, your objective is to block a given number of fireballs that are generated randomly. As you reach a new level, you have to block more fireballs, which begin to increase in speed. If I had more time, I would definitely work on improving the animations as well as creating more levels and implementing a leaderboard. Instructions are provided prior to beginning the game.</p>
    <h2><a href="https://fanstar.herokuapp.com/">FanStar</a></h2>
    <img src="./images/fanstar.png" alt="FanStar" class="project-img" />
    <p class="projectInfo">Have you ever wanted to prove to one of your friends that you're a bigger Yankee fan than they are? With FanStar, you'll have a way to prove it. The idea is that you choose a favorite team and record how many games you've been to for your favorite team. You will be assigned a ranking based on the number of games you've been to. I worked on this app with two other coworkers, so each of us had responsibilities that we agreed upon and organized using a Trello board. We used HTML, CSS, React, and Express. I took it upon myself to do all of our styling through CSS, and I also helped with React components and APIs through Express.</p>
    <h2><a href="https://mixtape-project.herokuapp.com/">Mixtape</a></h2>
    <img src="./images/mixtape.png" alt="FanStar" class="project-img" />
    <p class="projectInfo">This is without a doubt the project that I am most proud of. It combines two of my biggest passions: basketball and hip-hop music. I gained the inspiration for this app while listening to one of my teachers at General Assembly, who encouraged us to be creative. He shared a video with us that was all about how new ideas are born by remixing existing ideas. This resonated with me, because I have always been a fan of watching basketball highlights while listening to my favorite music in the background. But I wanted to be able to watch "mixtapes" of any player while listening to any song I want in the background. I did this by creating a database of players and rappers, each with their own name, image, and YouTube video link. Unfortunately, some of the videos are blocked for Copyright, but most of them are playable. I developed this app with HTML, CSS, React, and Express. If I had more time, I would have implemented a YouTube search component so users aren't limited to the players and rappers that I seeded into my database, but since I am so passionate about this app I am motivated to work on implementing this feature during my free time.</p>
