    <p class="projectInfo">I created this game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The idea came from my intrigue for Epic Games' very own <i>Fortnite</i>, a game that involves building structures to shield yourself from incoming bullets by enemies. In this game, your objective is to block a given number of fireballs that are generated randomly. As you reach a new level, you have to block more fireballs, which begin to increase in speed. If I had more time, I would definitely work on improving the animations as well as creating more levels and implementing a leaderboard. Instructions are provided prior to beginning the game.</p>
